# Some-Operations-on-System-Check

Here are some fetching processing on your computer. 
I wrote down on the Jupyter Notebook these codes. 

The first one is about the fetching CPU properties for your PC.
Second one is again fetching process to your RAM properties. 
The last one is easy but funny one. It's about getting system informations about your computer like 
'OS' of the PC; node, platform and processor of your computer.
